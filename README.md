This is one of my course assignments, which aims to obtain hands on experience on the statistical analysis methods introduced in the course using R. 
The report focuses on the difference in staff performance given the staff's marital status and gender based on the data and analysis from paper "Does Working from Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment" by Bloom et al(2015). <br />

In my report, I measured the difference in staff performance using several statistical model including least square linear regresion, fixed effect model, and random effect model, and found that there are significant gender difference when working from home. <br />
