## Gender-Marriage-Difference-on-WFH

This is one of my course assignments in my master studies. 
The assignment aims to obtain hands on experience on the statistical analysis methods introduced in the course using R. 
The report focuses on the difference in staff performance given the staff's marital status and gender based on the paper "Does Working from Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment" by Bloom et al(2013). 
You may find the paper for free [here](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/wfh.pdf).
The data is publicly available, to access the data click [here](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/wfh.zip).
